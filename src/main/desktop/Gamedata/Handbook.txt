Advisor Advice:\tPart 2
\tWhat should you NOT bring to your advisement meeting?
\t\tYour homework. It's not their job to help you with it!
\tIf you're having emotional difficulty adapting to life at UD, it's probably better to
\t contact the University's Counseling Center. They're trained to help!
\tIf you're sick and can't go to a class, email your class's instructor, not your advisor!
\t\t And if it's really bad, head over to Student Health!
\t\t\t No really, don't go to class sick.
