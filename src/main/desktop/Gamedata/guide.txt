Hey there, you look a little lost! You know where you are, right? You are in the Trabant Student Center!:
Well that's a nifty backpack you got there, what do you have inside?"
Hmmm, your backpack doesn't have anything in it! That's pretty useless. How about this, I'll give you my spare notebook.:
Some students may not have questions and just want to tell you some information about UD!:
Try walking around and talking to the students by getting close to them and answering their questions!:
When you're done, go south of Trabant to your advisor's office!:
Double click on the answers to select them when they appear! Good Luck!:
